There have been previous periods of climate change, but the current changes are distinctly more rapid and not due to natural causes.Instead, they are caused by the emission of greenhouse gases, mostly carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane. Burning fossil fuels for energy use creates most of these emissions. Agriculture, steelmaking, cement production, and forest loss are additional sources.As human behavior and choices destabilize the Earthâ€™s climate and biosphere, policymakers will need to do more. The shared nature of the threat also shows the need for closer and more comprehensive international cooperation to preserve the habitat in which human life has thrived.";
const homeStaringContent2 = "Extinction is the termination of a kind of organism or of a group of kinds (taxon), usually a species. The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the last individual of the species, although the capacity to breed and recover may have been lost before this point. Because a species' potential range may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively. This difficulty leads to phenomena such as Lazarus taxa, where a species presumed extinct abruptly 'reappears' (typically in the fossil record) after a period of apparent absence."
